# Calculating Nash equilibrium on quantum annealers

The content of this github repository contains the simulation of the examples found in the paper.

You can reproduce the same results by following the instructions given below: 

## Environment Setup

The code has been tested using Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

The following commandline should install the required packages. It's always good to create a virtual environement to avoid dependencies issues.
```
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk==4.4.0 dwave-neal==0.5.9 
```

# Notebooks
The content of this Jupyter Notebook [Nash Equilibrium](https://github.com/DarkStarQuantumLab/NashEquilibrium/blob/main/Nash_Equilibrium.ipynb) can be run on Colab and it contains the two examples mentioned in the paper.
